[![SAP](https://i.imgur.com/HBBBde7.png)](https://cloudplatform.sap.com)
This application implements some of the SAP Leonardo Machine Learning APIs for image processing. 

### Overview
- It is coded in [NodeJ](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Can be deployed anywhere and I suggest to do it in the  [SAP Cloud Platform](https://cloudplatform.sap.com). 
- It makes use of the [Image Feature Extraction](https://api.sap.com/shell/discover/contentpackage/SAPLeonardoMLFunctionalServices/api/img_feature_extraction_api), [Similarity Scoring](https://api.sap.com/shell/discover/contentpackage/SAPLeonardoMLFunctionalServices/api/similarity_scoring_api) and [Image Classifier APIs](https://api.sap.com/shell/discover/contentpackage/SAPLeonardoMLFunctionalServices/api/image_classification_api)

### Installation in the Cloud
Clone this repository
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Ralphive/b1leo.git
```
Give a name to your app on the [manifest.yml](manifest.yml)

From the root directory, using the [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) push your app to the SAP CP Cloud Foundry
```sh
$ cf push
```
It also requires a [SAP Leonardo API Key](https://api.sap.com/shell/discover/contentpackage/SAPLeonardoMLFunctionalServices/api/document_feature_extraction_api) which you can retrive **AFTER** login into the API Hub and clicking on GET API KEY.
```sh
$ cf set-env cfdemosummit18 LEO_API_KEY <YOUR API KEY>
```

Restart your application (so it can read the new environment variables)
```sh
$ cf restart <your app name set on the manifest.yml>
```

Access the app from the URL route shown in the terminal

### Usage
There are two functionalities
- Find similar items: If you upload a **shoe** picture, it will give you a similar item in return. You can have your own comparision database by adding pictures to the /files/imgs folder.
- Categorize: It works with any kind of picture

# Demo app
